🌩️ TypeStorm

Welcome to TypeStorm – a fast-paced typing challenge where your speed, accuracy, and memory are put to the ultimate test!

---

🎮 Game Description

TypeStorm is a browser-based game where you must type the exact words provided by the computer (that’s me 😄) to score points. But there’s a twist:

- You must type each word with 100% accuracy.
- Words appear in a sequence, and you must **remember the order** to target the correct word.
- Type fast, stay focused, and dominate the storm!

🕹️ How to Play

1. Start the game – you'll see words falling from the top of the screen.
2. Type the correct word exactly as shown.
3. Only the word at the bottom is your active target — don’t get distracted by others!
4. Score points by typing it correctly before it hits the bottom.
5. Miss a word or make a mistake, and you lose your chance!
